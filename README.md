## Contribution Guideline
You know the usual, fork, branch, pull request.

Questions Guide:
 - Screenshot the questions as opposed to copying. This makes it harder for companies to search and flag them on copyright
 - Name questions `Task 1`, `Task 2`. If question is longer than 1 screenshot use `Task 1(1)`, `Task 1(2)`
 - Create folder with the company name and add questions there. If company exists, check if question is already there, if not add increment number.
